## Introduction

Our research question is: "At what nightly price should we list our Vancouver AirBnB?" 

This research question is predictive. Given the dataset, we want to build a machine learning model that can predict an appropriate nightly price for a new AirBnB property. An appropriate price would be one that is competitive compared to existing listings given the property, host and booking specific characteristics. 

Examples of these characteristics are below:

Property-related characteristics: property type, the neighborhood, number of people who can be accommodated, number of bathrooms, bedrooms and beds.

Host-related characteristics: host response rate to requests, whether the host is a superhost, whether the host identity has been verified.

Booking-related characteristics: whether the property can be instantly booked, the cancellation policy
To answer this overarching question, we would need to understand the following:

Which features from the raw dataset would be most predictive of nightly price?
Which machine learning model at which hyperparameter settings can best predict nightly price?
Under what range of parameter values (e.g., charactistics of properties) would our model perform reliably?

## Dataset and Source

We have chosen a dataset that outlines Vancouver AirBnB listings. The dataset can be found here under the Vancouver, British Columbia section. A direct link to download the dataset is here. Data was compiled November 9 2019.

## Findings and Results

Which machine laerning model can best predict nightly price?

```{r baseline table, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
baseline <- read_csv("output/baseline_results.csv")
kable(baseline, caption = "Table 1 shows the baseline training and validation mean squared errors and training and validation learning time.")
```

```{r optimized table, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
optimized <- read_csv("output/optimized_results.csv")

kable(optimized, caption = "Table 2 shows the optimized training and validation mean squared errors and training and validation learning time.")

```
